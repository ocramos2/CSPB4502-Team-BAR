## Description of the project
This project's goal is to find fantastic feats in the NFL and study their impacts using play-by-play data from NFL seasons from years 2009 - 2018. We wish to understand the confluence of statistical factors that lead to outlier performances. We also wish to build a model that incorporates data from this wide range of seasons to predict the outcomes of plays and games given the presence of outliers. Overall, the project seeks to emulate the work of an NFL front office in finding fantastic feats of football through methods involving linear regression as its primary data mining lens.

## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers

Which aspects of a play have the greatest impact on play outcome? \
*In looking at EPA, the most influential attributes were found to be: WPA, yards gained, first-down pass, complete pass, yards after catch, third-down converted, pass touchdown, touchdown, first down rush, yards net*

Can players be classified into levels of achieving tiers based on their performance in their plays? \
*Yes, it was found that there are clear clusters of high-performance players in multiple categories, including quarterback/wide-receiver duos, explosive running backs, and high-performing quarterbacks under pressure.*

Which players perform the highest when faced with high-pressure situations, such as on 4th down or in the red zone? \
*A cluster was identified for these quarterbacks who perform well under pressure which included Drew Brees, Payton Manning, and Tom Brady, Colin Kaepernick, Tony Romo*

## Application of this knowledge

NFL Coaches/Support Staff can craft gameplans to give their team an edge based on knowledge of what most impacts each play's performance.  General Managers and team owners can identify starting players and know who to sign or who might be low-performing.  Similarly, sports betting can better predict the outcome of games based on data using a similar regression model or based on player clustering.

## How to Use this Repository
To obtain the code from this repository and access the data, run the programs, or contribute, clone the project using:
`git clone https://github.com/CSPB4502-Team-BAR/ProjectHome.git`

Because the dataset is greater than 100MB, it must be compressed and accessed locally. While inside of the main project directory, simply unzip the file using:
`unzip Dataset.zip`
(or your favorite de-compression tool)
